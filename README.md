# Sentimen-analysis

In this code we have sentiment analysis about the reviews of website.

first we read Positive/Negative reviews and stopwords, then we tokenize them.
then we remove the tokens which are less than 2 letters and also we removed the stopword
then we make a vector fro the tokens and we count the occurance of each token,
at the end we use Logistic regression
